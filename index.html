            <p class="lead">1.	In lesson 3 I learned a lot of smaller things that I did not realize make a big difference. I learned about how to make a github account. I was introduced to a new website and I learned about new things that cloud9 can do. Github is a website that gives users the chance to use a git which can make repositories. Repositories are basically a tool that can organize coding and can show the history of changes done to the repository. This interests me because it is something that I did not know existed until now and it seems like it will prove to be a useful tool.

            <p class="lead">Lesson 3 taught us how to make a repository that can be linked to our cloud9 workspace. After putting our information into github it gave us account information that could be copied and added into cloud 9 as a command that then linked our account. After entering the commands, github.com had all of the information that was in our lesson 3 workspace. I found it interesting that you can link the github account to the cloud9 workspace and I am curious to learn about what this can be used for. This is relevant to this class because it will be a tool for us to use to make designs and it will help us make web applications easier.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In Lesson 3 I learned about what a “ReadMe” file is and why it is important. A “ReadMe” file is a short file included with some software written by the software’s author. It contains basic information about the software and about the who the author is. Things like the date, author’s name, and a brief summary of the software are included so people can have some background information on how the code was written and what it is intended to to. This is interesting because it is like a hidden about the author that coders know about. This is relevant to our class because it is another step in knowing the basics of what writing code includes.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In Lesson 3 we learned new commands to type into the terminal of cloud 9. New commands that were taught include “git init”,”git add .”, and “git commit -m (descriptive message)”. The first command, “git init” is used to create a new repository in github. When “git add .” is entered in the terminal it brings all of the files in the section to the git to be used later. Lastly “git commit –m” is used to make a snapshot and basically tells when something should be read as a message. This is interesting to me because it is new but makes sense to me about why these commands are used. These are important because they are crucial commands that need to be used in order to make things work.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Unzipping Files</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Lesson 3 made it clear to me why it is important to upload the unzipped version of a file to cloud 9 when creating a new workspace. When taking an online file that is compressed into a zipped file it must be downloaded and then extracted, turning it back into all of the individual files that make up the whole file. This is important because it makes it so each file can be edited individually. Files can be zipped or compressed when there are many files that need to be sent to the same place, it makes it easier to move everything and takes less storage. Zipped files interest me because they seem like an efficient way to organize data.</p>
